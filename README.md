#Methods:

## do_quit(): Exit the program.
## do_EOF(): Exit the program on end-of-file.
## emptyline: Ignore empty lines.
## do_create(): Create and save a new instance of the specified class.
## do_show(): Print details of an instance by class name and id.
## do_destroy(): Delete an instance by class name and id.
## do_all(): Print string representations of instances by class or all.
## do_update(): Update instance attribute by class and id.
